# DeepSource Hiring Challenges

Hello! If you're reading this, then we are most likely in the process of chatting with you about a technical role with [DeepSource](https://deepsource.io)'s engineering team. If so, congrats! We can't wait to work with you. ðŸš€

We would love to see how you work â€” and this repository contains a set of short challenges that you can use to show us your abilities and skills. All of the challenges are designed to be completed in less than 2-3 hours and we encourage you to _not_ spend anything more than that.

Please note that these challenges are not meant to judge you on a rigid scale â€” rather, your submission will help us understand how you write code, how you think, and if you're a fit with our engineering culture. So feel free to go as deep and extensive as you possibly can with your solution to help us understand how passionate you are about your craft. We'd greatly appreciate that!

## Instructions

1. Choose a challenge that matches with the role that you are being considered for. Read the challenge description carefully. If you have any clarifying questions, you may create an issue in this repository or contact your hiring point of contact at DeepSource.

3. For your submission, create a new repository on GitHub. If your submission needs hosting, please specify the live URL in the repository's description or `README.md`. It would be great if you could provide a live link in addition to the source code â€” for extra brownie points!

4. Complete as much of the challenge as you can without spending more than 2-3 hours on it. Unless specified otherwise, you are free to use any language or framework you want â€” although ideally we'd prefer if you use one of these: Python, Go (back-end), VueJS, TailwindCSS (front-end).

5. Make sure your solution includes the following things:

    1. A `README.md` with the following information:

        - A short explanation of what you've built. If there are screenshots, please add them.
        - If there are tests, instructions on running the test suite. If there's a live demo, the link to it.
        - Anything else you'd like us to know about your submission.
    2. A `ROADMAP.md`, explaining the things you would have liked to add or change if you had more time. This is optional.
    3. A test suite if applicable. This could be as simple as you want. If you can hook up a CI, all the better.
    4. Some form of lightweight documentation, like code comments.

6. Once you're done, please send the link to the repository to your hiring point of contact at DeepSource. We generally tend to be pretty quick with the reviews, so you should be hearing back from us within 48 hours.
